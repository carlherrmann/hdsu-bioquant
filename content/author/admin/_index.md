The **Biomedical Genomics Group @ Health Data Science Unit** at the BioQuant Center and Medical Faculty Heidelberg is working on understanding gene (de)regulation in disease. We develop novel methods to integrate large scale genomics datasets, using statistical and machine-learning approaches. We focus in particular on epigenomics data and single-cell approaches.

We are contributing to the **OpenLab Epigenomics** initiative to provide support and expertise to groups generating large scale epigenomics datasets like ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and chromatin interaction data.
