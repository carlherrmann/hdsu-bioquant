I am currently a scientific research associate at <a href="https://hdsu-bioquant.netlify.com/">the Health Data Science Unit, </a> Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg, Germany. I did my doctoral studies from <a href="https://www.dkfz.de/en/index.html">German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)</a> and <a href="http://www.leibniz-hki.de/en/home.html"> Hans Knöll Institute (HKI) </a>. After my PhD, I briefly worked as a scientific associate at <a href="http://www.cscc.uniklinikum-jena.de/cscc/en/CSCC.html">The Center for Sepsis Control & Care</a>, Universitätsklinikum Jena. I have a Masters degree in Genomics from <a href="http://www.genomicsmku.org/">Madurai Kamraj University</a>, India and a Bachelors degree in Biotechnology from <a href="http://www.vit.ac.in/">Vellore Institute of Technology</a>, India</p>

I contribute to <b>The Epigenomics OpenLab</b> which is an alliance of experimental and computational groups in DKFZ and Medical Faculty, University Heidelberg to analyse and process wide variety of epigenomics and single cell datasets. The OpenLab provides high quality analysis pipelines.

I have over 7 years of experience in applying various statistical and computational tools for integrative (epi)-genomics based analysis to answers translational and fundamental questions related to tumor biology.
