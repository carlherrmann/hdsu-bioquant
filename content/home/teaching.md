### Bachelor thesis projects 2020

Here are some possible topics/projects for students wanting do to their bachelor thesis in our group during the summer semester 2020

#### Topic 1 : using single-cell data to interpret expression data from patients

Currently, more and more single-cell RNA-seq datasets are generated to increase the resolution of transcriptomics to the single-cell level. These datasets allow to understand the mixture of cell types within a tissue sample, and have been applied to create atlases of cell types from mouse embryos. On the other hand, these are thousands of bulk RNA-seq datasets available, which lack this resolution. We are working on implementing methods to re-interpret bulk datasets using single-cell information, and map for example patient data onto trajectories defined from single-cell expression. The project would be to contribute to the development of this method, in particular the visualization of the data, and to apply it to a large set of pediatric tumor types. Comparison to datasets of normal tumor would be used to validate the method.

Main aspects:

* data analysis of sequencing data
* interactive visualization using Shiny
* comparative genomics (mouse/human)
